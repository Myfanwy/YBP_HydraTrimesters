# YBP_HydraTrimesters
Uses an R Script to automate the formatting of Vemco detection data for Hydra


Current functionality: takes a detection .csv exported from VUE and formats it to match your deployment files.  This requires some visual confirmation of start and end dates - hoping to automate that in the future.
